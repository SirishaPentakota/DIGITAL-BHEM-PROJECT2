# DIGITAL-BHEM-PROJECT2
Created a Python-based reminder application using Tkinter for the GUI, allowing users to add reminders with date and time. It checks and displays reminders when their time is due, utilizing multi-threading. Users can easily manage their reminders and get notified accordingly. This application offers a user-friendly way to stay organized and on top of important tasks.
